# Environment Variables Template

# This file is used to set up environment variables for the project.
# It should be renamed to .env.local and filled with the correct values.
# Do not commit the file to version control as it might contain
# sensitive information like API keys or credentials.

# Instructions:
# - Copy this file to .env.local
# - Replace placeholder values with real ones
# - Never commit .env files to your repository.

# Public API URLs that will be exposed to the frontend.

# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=
# NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# These variables are used for authentication purposes within the application.
# They represent a mock user ID, email and password for development and testing.
# You may define them with your own values during local development.

# Note: In a real-world scenario, authentication should be handled by a secure back-end service.
# Sensitive user data (like passwords) should never be hard-coded or stored in environment variables
# for production environments.
